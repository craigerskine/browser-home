Simple browser home page/new tab page. Uses tailwindcss and moment.js

### Requirements

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Usage

1. Download the project and extract to a folder on your system.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
3. Type the following commands:

`npm install` - you only need to do this the first time

`./node_modules/.bin/gulp`

A browser window will open and the changes you make in the `css`, `js`, `index.html`, `tailwind.js`, etc. will auto reload the browser instance.

Upload the contents of the `live` folder to your web host for your own personal version.
