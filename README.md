# browser-home

Simple browser home page/new tab page.  


### Requirements

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Usage

1. Download the project and extract to a folder on your system.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
3. Type the following commands:

`npm install` - you only need to do this the first time

`./node_modules/.bin/gulp`

A browser window will open and the changes you make in the `css`, `js`, `index.html` will auto reload the browser instance.
